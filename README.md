# ALX Interview Preparation Repository

## Overview

This repository was created as part of my interview preparation. It primarily focuses on solving problems related to Python data structures, including arrays, linked lists, and other essential topics. The repository contains solutions and explanations for various coding problems commonly asked in technical interviews.

## Topics Covered

### Arrays
- **Concepts:** 
  - Manipulating elements in arrays.
  - Searching, sorting, and performing operations like reverse, rotate, etc.
  - Optimizing solutions to minimize time and space complexity.

### Linked Lists
- **Concepts:** 
  - Implementing and understanding both singly and doubly linked lists.
  - Solving problems related to traversal, insertion, deletion, and reversal of linked lists.
  - Handling edge cases such as cycles in linked lists and merging two lists.

### Other Data Structures
- **Stacks and Queues:** 
  - Using stacks and queues to solve problems such as balanced parentheses, next greater element, etc.
- **Trees and Graphs:** 
  - Basic traversal techniques such as depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).
- **Hash Tables:** 
  - Efficient data retrieval using hash maps.
- **Dynamic Programming:** 
  - Solving optimization problems using memoization and tabulation techniques.

## Structure of the Repository

Each topic is organized into its own directory with the following structure:

```
/arrays
    - problem_1.py
    - problem_2.py
/linked_lists
    - singly_linked_list.py
    - doubly_linked_list.py
    - linked_list_problems.py
/other_data_structures
    - stacks_queues.py
    - trees_graphs.py
    - hash_tables.py
/dynamic_programming
    - dp_problem_1.py
    - dp_problem_2.py
```

Each file contains:
- **Problem Statement:** A description of the problem being solved.
- **Solution:** The implemented solution in Python.
- **Explanation:** A detailed explanation of the approach and the underlying concepts.

## Resources Used

During preparation, I relied on a variety of resources to help me understand key concepts and solve problems. Below are some of the most helpful resources:

- **Python Official Documentation:**
  - [Python Data Structures](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html) (Lists, dictionaries, sets)
  - [Iterators and Generators](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#iterators)

- **LeetCode:** 
  - [LeetCode Arrays Problems](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/)
  - [LeetCode Linked Lists Problems](https://leetcode.com/tag/linked-list/)

- **GeeksforGeeks:** 
  - [Array Interview Questions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-50-array-coding-problems-for-interviews/)
  - [Linked List Interview Questions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-20-linked-list-interview-question/)

- **Cracking the Coding Interview:** 
  - Solved problems from the book to strengthen my problem-solving skills.

## Approach

My preparation was structured around the following approach:
1. **Understand the Basics:** For each data structure, I reviewed the underlying theory and the basic operations (e.g., insertions, deletions, traversals).
2. **Solve Easy Problems First:** I started by solving basic problems to get a solid grasp on implementation techniques.
3. **Tackle Harder Problems:** Gradually, I moved on to more complex problems that required advanced algorithms and optimizations.
4. **Practice, Practice, Practice:** Consistent practice helped improve my speed and accuracy in solving problems under time constraints.

## Requirements

### General
- All Python files are written in Python 3.
- Each script is executable and can be run directly from the command line.
- The code adheres to `pycodestyle` guidelines.
- No external libraries are used unless explicitly stated in the problem description.
  
### Recommended Tools
- **Code Editor:** VSCode, PyCharm, or any Python-supported editor.
- **Testing:** Use the Python `unittest` framework for testing solutions.

## Conclusion

This repository serves as a study guide for interview preparation in Python, covering foundational concepts in data structures and algorithms. By working through these problems, I was able to strengthen my coding skills, improve my problem-solving ability, and become more confident in my technical interview readiness.

Feel free to explore the repository and use the solutions as a reference for your own preparation.
