# Rotate 2D Matrix

## Project Overview

In this project, you will implement an in-place algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. This challenge focuses on matrix manipulation and in-place operations in Python.

## Concepts Needed

### Matrix Representation in Python
- Understanding how 2D matrices are represented using lists of lists in Python.
- Accessing and modifying elements in a 2D matrix.

### In-place Operations
- Performing operations on data without creating a copy of the data structure.
- Minimizing space complexity by modifying the matrix in place.

### Matrix Transposition
- Understanding the concept of transposing a matrix (swapping rows and columns).
- Implementing matrix transposition as a step in the rotation process.

### Reversing Rows in a Matrix
- Manipulating rows of a matrix by reversing their order as part of the rotation process.

### Nested Loops
- Using nested loops to iterate through 2D data structures like matrices.
- Modifying elements within nested loops to achieve the desired rotation.

## Resources

- **Python Official Documentation:**
  - [Data Structures](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html) (list comprehensions, nested list comprehension)
  - [More on Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists)

- **GeeksforGeeks Articles:**
  - [Inplace rotate square matrix by 90 degrees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inplace-rotate-square-matrix-by-90-degrees/)
  - [Transpose a matrix in Single line in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transpose-matrix-single-line-python/)

- **TutorialsPoint:**
  - [Python Lists](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_lists.htm) for basics of list manipulation in Python.

## Approach

1. **Transpose the Matrix:**
   - Swap the rows and columns of the matrix.

2. **Reverse Each Row:**
   - Reverse the order of elements in each row to achieve the 90-degree clockwise rotation.
