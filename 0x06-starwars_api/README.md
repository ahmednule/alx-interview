This project, "0. Star Wars Characters," involves interacting with an external API to retrieve and display information about Star Wars characters based on a provided movie ID. Successfully completing this project requires a solid understanding of web programming fundamentals, API interaction, and asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

Required Concepts

HTTP Requests in JavaScript: Mastering how to make HTTP requests to external services using either the request module or alternatives like fetch in Node.js. (https://github.com/scotch-io/node-api)
Working with APIs: Understanding RESTful APIs and interacting with them effectively. This includes parsing JSON data returned by these APIs. (https://github.com/scotch-io/node-api)
Asynchronous Programming: Managing asynchronous operations through callbacks, promises, or async/await syntax. This is crucial for handling API response data asynchronously. (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous)   
Command Line Arguments in Node.js: Utilizing the process.argv array to access command-line arguments passed to a Node.js script. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4351521/how-do-i-pass-command-line-arguments-to-a-node-js-program-and-receive-them)
Array Manipulation and Iteration: Familiarity with iterating over arrays and manipulating data structures for formatting and displaying character names. (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)   
Learning Resources

By familiarizing yourself with these concepts and the provided resources, you'll be equipped to efficiently retrieve, process, and display Star Wars characters from the specified movie using the Star Wars API. This demonstrates your capabilities in working with external APIs and managing asynchronous code in JavaScript.
